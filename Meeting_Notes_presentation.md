## What to present? 

Instructions by the lecturer

**"Present one of the topics below, according to your group number.
There isn't enough time for a comprehensive discussion of the topic, so please prepare some essential examples, which are the most interesting from your point of view. (You can use any relevant sources, not only the provided links.)
Prepare the presentation in a way that you don't lose time to technical problems; e.g. open all required tabs and documents in advance, and pre-configure Git to store your credentials, so you don't need to type or copy-paste them (Stackoverflow).
There is no requirement that every group member speaks during the presentation, but if you want, you can divide the presentation so that different group members get a chance to speak.
Also, create a public gist in markdown format with the most important information from your presentation, as a short summary/handout for other students.
The presentation may be accompanied by some questions, which all group members should be able to answer. The resulting grade is group-based, i.e. it's the same for all group members."**
